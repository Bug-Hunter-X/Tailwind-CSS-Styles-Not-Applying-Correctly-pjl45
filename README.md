# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with Tailwind CSS: styles not applying as expected.

The `bug.js` file shows the code snippet with the styling problem.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution.

The problem lies in the way the classes are structured or a missing configuration element.
